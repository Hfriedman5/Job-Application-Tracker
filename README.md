# Job Application Tracker

A modern, lightweight, and responsive web application designed to help job seekers organize their job search. This tool provides a centralized dashboard to track applications, monitor statuses (Interviewing, Offer, Rejected), and visualize success metrics with real-time statistics.

    * **Timeline:** Tracks applications per week/month and days since the last application.
    * **Location Analysis:** Automatically groups applications by location.
* **Application Management:**
    * Add detailed entries (Company, Job Title, Salary Range, Link, Notes).
    * Update statuses (Applied ➝ Interviewing ➝ Offer ➝ Accepted/Rejected).
    * Log specific salary offers when statuses are updated.
* **Search & Filter:** Instantly filter applications by status or search by keyword (Company, Title, Location).
* **Bulk Actions:** Delete multiple selected applications at once.
* **Modern UI:** Built with a "Glassmorphism" design aesthetic using CSS variables, gradients, and backdrop filters.
